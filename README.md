# Raylib Game Template

This repository is a template for a game in [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib); it uses [CMake](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake) as the build system.

## Getting Started

First, clone the project with git

```sh 
git clone https://github.com/Nineteenn1/Raylib-Game-Template.git
```

or click the "Use this template" button above.


If you want to see what the template game looks like, build the project with CMake using the following commands:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build

cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

To start the game use this if you are on Windows:
```sh
start Debug/game
```

And this if you are on Linux:
```sh
./Debug/game
```
